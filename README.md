# Stick Arena Stats Checker
A stats checking app for stick arena that I made some time ago for mobile platform (android) in android studio (Java).

# NOTE
I know in Activity2.java the strictmode manipulations are not the best solution, but AsyncTask was annoying me and this is a very simple app anyways.

# How does the app look like?
